# Instructions for the First Mission: Hello World

Welcome to the first mission of the Python tutorial! In this mission, you will learn the basics of Python programming by creating a simple "Hello, World!" application.

## Mission Objectives

1. **Understand the Basics**: Familiarize yourself with Python syntax and structure.
2. **Write Your First Program**: Create a Python script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
3. **Run Your Code**: Learn how to execute your Python script and see the output.

## Steps to Complete the Mission

1. **Open the Starter Code**: Navigate to the `starter_code.py` file in the `mission_01_hello_world` directory. This file contains a template for your mission.
   
2. **Modify the Starter Code**: 
   - In the `starter_code.py` file, you will find a placeholder comment. Replace this comment with the code that prints "Hello, World!".
   
3. **Test Your Code**: 
   - After writing your code, run the script to ensure it works correctly. You should see "Hello, World!" printed in your console.

4. **Review the Solution**: 
   - Once you have completed your code, you can check the `solution.py` file to see how the mission is solved. This will help you understand the correct implementation.

5. **Submit Your Work**: 
   - If your code works as expected, you can consider this mission complete! 

## Tips

- Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
- If you encounter any errors, read the error messages carefully; they often provide clues on what went wrong.
