# Python Tutorial Missions

Welcome to the Python Tutorial Missions repository! This project is designed to help learners improve their Python skills through a series of coding missions. Each mission includes instructions, starter code, a solution, and tests to validate your implementation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **app.py**: The main entry point of the application.
  - **missions/**: Contains all the coding missions.
    - **mission_01_hello_world/**: The first mission, which introduces you to Python basics.
  - **validators/**: Contains validation logic for mission submissions.
  - **api/**: Defines API endpoints for interacting with missions and validations.
  - **models/**: Contains data models related to missions.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for missions and validators to ensure everything works as expected.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

- **.env.example**: An example environment configuration file.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to ignore in version control.
